# RS232

This project was created during my studies for educational purposes only. The main goal of the project was to create a working communicator between two instances of the application. Requirements contain usage of RS232 protocol to code messages and profanity detection by swears dictionary. Moreover, the project was expanded by the usage of TCP/IP protocol to send data, after coding in RS232, and dedicated windows to show a form of each byte of data. Below is some example of dialog between two instances of the program.
